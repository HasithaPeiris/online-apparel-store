KRO is a tailored suit brand embodying the Japanese concept of “Wabi Sabi” and caters to creating their customers high-quality, multifunctional clothing. Aiming to uplift the sense of self within their consumers, KRO believes in the quote “Be Imperfectly Real, It’s Perfectly Rare”; placing emphasis on discovering the beauty within the so called ‘imperfect’ and ‘flawed’ ways of living in a modern culture where perfection is the norm.

Mainly featuring the SS20 collection which manifested the brand, KRO is all about willingly adhering to imperfect and seamless designs as opposed to the symmetrical and clean. In other words, KRO is a brand that goes a step beyond the innovation cliche of “thinking outside the box” all the way to attempting to overthrow convention itself.

As such, the goal of this project is the creation of a powerful and sleek Online Store web application which will encompass humble and unpretentious values in order to perfectly represent the vision and concept of the brand.
